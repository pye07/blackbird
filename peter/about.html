      Peter Ye is an aspiring conductor and music educator who works with his peers to create music and inspire others. As a music education major at UCLA, Peter actively works in his community as a music educator and percussionist in the greater Ventura and Los Angeles County.

      Growing up in Oak Park, California, Peter began playing piano when he was six. Since joining band in middle school, Peter picked up the oboe, but when that did work out very well, he decided to play percussion. In high school, Peter was involved in the band program, playing in the jazz band and being the drum major of the marching band. He was also an active percussionist, working with renowned guest conductors, such as Robert Ponto (Oregon University) and Anthony Maiello (George Mason University). In addition, Peter has studied conducting under Maestro Neil Thomson (Orquestra Filarmônica de Goiás) and Dr. Scott Weiss (University of Southern Carolina) at the LA Conducting Workshop and Competition, where Peter was a semi-finalist.

      Peter comes from a family of Bruins, with both of his older sisters being UCLA alumni. At UCLA, Peter plays in many different ensembles, including the percussion ensemble, marching band, wind ensemble and orchestra. He looks forward to continuing in his musical endeavors and exploring his interests at the Herb Alpert School of Music. Peter loves being a part of this campus and is thankful for the opportunity to be here! Go Bruins!
