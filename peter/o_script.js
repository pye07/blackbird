    document.getElementById("o").innerHTML="<p>            While I was unfortunately only present for the final twenty minutes of class, I was still able to see a lot of Ms. Jones’s personality and effectiveness as a teacher. Her energy was apparent throughout the entire class, and she was always keeping momentum throughout the class. With zoom, it can be hard to have the back-and-forth engagement that is natural in a class. Even the body language of occasional eye contact can give large signals on how a student is receiving information of paying attention. However, with online learning, a teacher has to trust the student’s ability to pay attention and be realistic with the realities of online learning. Ms. Jones approached the class in a way that exemplified her understanding of the class environment, her trust in her students, and therefore doing as much as possible in the given circumstances.</p><p>            Already, the integration of musicianship exercises says a lot about a teacher’s philosophies. The rhythm exercise was well planned and shows that Ms. Jones values overall musicianship rather than just learning how to play instruments and getting a concert together in time. All throughout the exercise, she was also very encouraging and reassuring toward the students. Whether good or bad, musicianship exercises can easily reveal large differences in students’ musical understanding, so some musicians will feel emboldened by these exercises while some musicians might feel insecure about their ability. Ms. Jones’s constant positive reinforcement was very helpful in creating a positive environment that focused on making sure all the students were learning rather than only reassuring already excellent musicians.</p><p>            Ms. Jones’s emphasis on musical cultural integration is also seen in her mini lecture on Florence Price. The historical context behind the composer was very helpful and educational for the students, and the piece we listened to was very beautiful. One important topic of discussion is the focus on diverse and historically underrepresented composers. With incorporating diversity as a hot topic in education right now, it is important to address this topic in the classroom. One concern, as brought up by a professor last quarter, is how teachers can tend to emphasize these topics over musical learning that can still be lacking in secondary music education. (He gave the example of many UCLA music majors not being able to sight sing when coming into college). Another concern is the tokenization of minority musicians, rather than true integration of diversity in our music culture. I don’t think this problem presented itself that strongly in Ms. Jones’s classroom, but I bring it up because there was one major criticism that I had of her class—the students never played any music. I’m not sure if it was just the class we happened to visit, but I think playing every day is integral to a band classroom. One aspect of my high school band director that I appreciated was his dedication to making sure we played as much as possible in our classroom. I never heard any negative feedback from my peers in that aspect because I believe that in any instrumental classroom the students’ ultimate desire is making music. It is important to discuss historical and societal contexts with music, but it should be integrated with the music being played in the classroom. So, rather than incorporating diversity for diversity’s sake, it becomes a well-rounded music culture.</p><p>            I also appreciated that Ms. Jones’s classroom was very well-organized. She had a plan from the beginning, and she stuck to it. The students in her class knew what to expect, and that can be very helpful especially in an online environment. With so many things being uncertain, it helps give the students and teacher peace at mind, as well as keeping constant momentum throughout the classroom. The only thing I would change is creating more room for student discussion and responses, especially during the “Musician of the Week” lecture. Without constant discussion, even in an in-person classroom, student can easily lose focus and have an hour of class wasted. So, the only problem that might arise with a minute-to-minute planned schedule is only having room for discussion and student input where it was planned beforehand. However, this was only a small problem and Ms. Jones still had multiple opportunities for students to give input.</p><p>            Overall, I enjoyed Ms. Jones’s classroom, and I was able to perceive a lot of information on how she planned the class and how students perceived her teaching style. The energy was apparent throughout the entire class, and I applaud her for being able to stay energized without the constant student engagement that one finds in an in-person classroom. I also really appreciate her integration of musicianship and music history in the classroom, and the only thing that I would change is incorporating more student playing in the classroom. At the end of the class, I was still unsure of which ensemble she was teaching (band, orchestra, or jazz band?). But, it was a fun experience and I was engaged throughout the entire period.</p>"

    document.getElementById("o").innerHTML="<p>            I though Dr. David Cubek was a great educator. It was obvious that he had put a lot of thought and intentionality into his teaching philosophy, and I wish that we could have had more time to discuss rehearsal with him.</p><p>            The main takeaway I received was having a plan for rehearsal. One of my foremost worries coming into rehearsal is either not having a plan or having too many prepared critiques in advance. Ultimately, both of these sides of the spectrum are selfish approaches; one lacks preparation and care for the ensemble, and the other is only focused on filling time and seeming like a perceptive conductor. I like how Dr. Cubek stressed the importance of being prepared, while still having some room for comments and ways for the ensemble to improve.</p><p>            I also liked when he brought up the conductor as a role model for the entire rehearsal. Especially being serious about starting time and not talking or acting leisurely when rehearsal is about to start. I remember when my band director would be occupied or taking care of business when rehearsal was supposed to start, it made the exact rehearsal time seem less urgent. I definitely want to be organized and on top of things as much as possible when I am leading rehearsals.</p><p>            The final takeaway I received from Dr Cubek’s talk was how to make comments during rehearsal. I have before that you should use positive feedback before giving any negative criticisms, and it is always a good reminder to know. I also liked how he said to not stop at every mistake, but rather keep track of them and address many as a whole. In my own insecurity, I would want to stop at every mistake to make sure that I do not forget anything, so I need to work on that for a success rehearsal for the ensemble.</p>"

  document.getElementById("o4").onclick = function() {
    document.getElementById("o").innerHTML="<p>            Ms. Kerri Epps was a very encouraging music educator, and it was great to hear from a UCLA alumnus who was so enthusiastic to speak to us.</p><p>            Coming from a band background, I do not know much about how to rehearse strings. I was surprised to see her promoting Essential Elements, because most of the strings educators that I have talked to recommend other method books. I liked her approach of utilizing and testing different method books, especially in making sure that I liked to book. Before, I never thought of how much I would be hearing the same music over and over as an educator, especially with method books.</p><p>            I also liked her discussion of different materials to buy for the classroom. Ultimately, I am not sure about sponges with the discussion we had toward the end of class. However, I appreciate the low-cost option that she provided for us, and the conversation we were able to have about why sponges do and do not work. I think that I would incorporate sponges if I did not have the money to purchase shoulder rests. But, if I could find space in the budget, I would rather have students use shoulder rests to learn proper technique and to avoid any possible injury from improper ergonomics.</p><p>            Something that I also took away was getting involved in different ensembles and using that experience to bolster education. I think it is helpful for overall education to be able to expose students to different forms of arts, and especially in music where we can easily separate different ensembles. It was not until college, where I began to perceive music, especially Western classical, as a whole. Instead, I also saw choir, band, and orchestra as three separate entities. While it is hard to adjust this view with the limitations of the K-12 class setting, I would want to strive for collaboration and let my students understand how the ensembles are related. Also, there are many ways to understand music from the perspective of one ensemble and apply it to another ensemble’s interpretations.</p>"

    document.getElementById("o").innerHTML="<p>            This site visit was at Obama Global Preparation Academy in LAUSD. Mr. Claudio Alcantar taught the class, which was a ukulele class because of COVID-19. The class was an hour long from 9:30 A.M. to 10:30 A.M., and it was in a hybrid format. None of the students were in the same classroom as the teacher, but there were some students who were participating on campus. I am not sure why students were on campus but not in the classroom, but we did not go over the details of the current hybrid model.</p><p>            Mr. Alcantar was obviously prepared for class, as he had a presentation that was used throughout the entire duration of class. He began with a title slide featuring a lot of cartoons and memes. The students were really getting into the fun of the classroom, notably “Sus Imposter David Gasga”. The class began with listening to “Cowboy Bepop” and a short discussion afterward about anime music led by the student teacher. I am not sure how effective or important the discussion felt to the students, but it was a fun discussion that the student teacher was obviously passionate about. It seems especially hard to insert social topics of discussion through online learning without seeming like it is virtue signaling. While it is AAPI Heritage month, the discussion seemed to be inserted just to be there, rather than contributing to the classroom curriculum. I would like to see them play music from Asian origins, as there are many easy folk songs that can be integrated into beginner classroom. However, this criticism can be unfair because we only visited one class, and I am not sure how the class fits into the overall curriculum.</p><p>            Next, the Mr. Alcantar did some rhythm and dictation exercises, which I am always a fan of. Here, it was obvious how hard it is to engage younger students online. Even just asking students to turn their camera on is a struggle. I think this was especially hard, when the continuation of class required students to show their work. So, if I ever find myself teaching students online, I will remember to have other ways to continue the class in order to be able to keep the class flow. To end the class, the students were able to play “Ode to Joy” on ukulele.</p><p>            I really enjoyed the PASTA check in, and it worked very well on the online format. I think it was a good use of the chat function, and I am always amazed when a teacher is able to overcome the less-than-ideal online situation and use the advantages of online learning, rather trying to fit an in-person format online.</p><p>            Overall, I enjoyed the class and thought Mr. Alcantar was a very genuine teacher. He maintained good control of the classroom without being stern, and he was able to maintain good energy while being very much himself. He never seemed negative and was very affirming to his students, while still being able to point out corrections and criticisms for the sake of the students.</p>"
