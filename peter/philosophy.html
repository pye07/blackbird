    <h2> Teaching Philosophy </h2>
    <div style= "margin: 50px; font-size:17px; ">
I believe music is an instrument for connecting people across cultures and developing interpersonal relationships with one another. A 2019 Harvard study found that music has existed as a part of every recorded human culture (Mehr et al., 2019). They not only found that music was present in every culture, but also learned that music is to indicate various behavioral contexts to express emotion states. There was not one single purpose for music shared between societies, but each culture had different types of music for different purposes—whether it be artistic expression, formal events, or religious worship. While specific aspects of music and expressions of sound vary between different societies, humanity shares a universal understanding and appreciation of music. Therefore, music not only connects us with other people, but also acts as a lens to perceive cultures and history. As a music educator, I passionately want to go beyond teaching students how to play instruments or read music. I also help students develop intrinsic musicality and musicianship through allowing the student to explore, create, and solve problems on their own. All of these ideas point to the ultimate goal of integrating students into today’s music culture. <br><br> Naturally, students not only have intrinsic musicality, but also have an inherit love for music (Zatorre, 2018). My ultimate goal is to further increase a student’s natural love for music. If a student loves music, then the learning process becomes more enjoyable, rather than tedious. It is my job to create an environment that encourages students to strive to become great musicians as a means to serve their own love for music. This love has to be nurtured by appealing to student’s interests, and constantly introducing new topics to build off their interests. Ideally, musical excellence should be achieved as a byproduct of a student’s desire for excellent music making. Every note played and practiced should come from a desire to strive for the best musical experience possible. <br><br>Discussing excellent music require defining the nature of excellence in music. Evaluating a piece’s “excellence” requires analyzing its effect on its intended sphere of influence. Throughout history, composers have introduced pieces or ideas that ultimately changed the course of music as a whole. This pattern is clearly expressed in Western music history, moving from the emphasis on consonant intervals to more contemporary ideas of “the emancipation of the dissonance”. There are also pieces that have become staples of cultures and traditions—folk songs passed down through generations, hymns sung for centuries by changing congregations, or symphonies that have lasted the test of time. However, subjectivity also plays a large influence in the conversation of defining excellent music, and there is no clear line that separates works of arts from the rest of music. <br><br>In this ideal, a student’s love for music needs to be accompanied by developing a true understanding of music theory and history. Music is so natural yet abstract, so it is very important to equip students with tools to tangibly grasp these abstract concepts (Savage et al., 2015). These tools are developed through not only an integrated curriculum of playing instruments, learning theory, and understanding historical contexts, but also experiencing music through singing, movement, and improvisation. A curriculum must be well planned in order to intentionally provide good musical repertoire, while leaving space for discussion of theoretical and historical concepts. In understanding musical notions, students are able to be more discerning in how to find and identify music that is valuable to their personal life and culture and be a part of present musical discussions. Far too many people have played an instrument at a young age, but completely forget what they learned within a few years. Music education should always strive to produce musicians for life. <br><br>Music also connects people. As mentioned before, every culture has some form of music making, so music is a universal gateway to experiencing and learning from cultures around the world. As a teacher, I will always strive to expose students to how different cultures interpret and express music. Because music is so integral to culture, it is important to shape the music curriculum in a way that furthers the many cultural backgrounds of each individual in the classroom. A comprehensive philosophy should be “conservative in its concern for preserving the integrity of music cultures (dance cultures, etc.) of the American macroculture, yet liberal insofar as it goes beyond particular cultural preferences to confront beliefs systems, processes, and problems, including the shared concerns of musicians from emerging music cultures.” (Elliot, 1990, p. 163) Especially in America, where a diverse mix of cultures exist, it is increasingly more important that we integrate music into schools. Music classrooms can be one of the only spaces where conversations of different musical cultures can be discussed whether guided by the different experiences of each student, or by a curriculum created and presented by the teacher. <br><br>Therefore, I believe quality music should be accessible to all students. With the goal of connecting people and integrating students into culture, music education has to be universal to all students. Musical culture should encompass all people, and if music education is limited to certain groups of people, then the universality of music becomes limited and partial. Music education should never be denied to those who want it. <br><br>Practically, music education also provides students opportunities to learn skills in teamwork, confidence, communication, organization, and leadership (Emiliani & Emiliani, 2013). There are many ways students may serve in leadership and team roles, from being a principal player in orchestra to planning fundraisers for the music program. It is part of my job to always make sure that my students feel like a valued member of the program, and I will always work to make sure there is a way for students to serve, in order to best suit their needs and strengths. <br><br>Ultimately, music education must strive to create musicians and people beyond a music classroom. Music is not just closely related to human nature, but it is an integral part of humanity. By neglecting musical education, students are missing a valuable and necessary part of understanding and participating in culture. For millennia, music has served as a mode of human expression and reflection of the current society, and as a music educator I believe it is a cardinal subject for any student.
