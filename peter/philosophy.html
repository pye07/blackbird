I love music because of its universality. Music not only connects us with other people, but also acts as a lens to perceive cultures, history, emotion. As a music educator, I passionately want to go far beyond learning instruments within a classroom and help students become a part of music as a whole. That, while students will be learn practical musical skills in the classroom, they will also be able to understand how music pervades daily life and is a part of every person. I strive to constantly learn more ways to build upon a student’s natural ability while allowing the student to explore, create, and solve problems on their own. In this endeavor, I look forward to collaborating with other fervent educators to constantly gain understanding that will help the overall music education community.<br><br>My ultimate goal is to further increase a student’s natural love for music. If a student loves music, then everything about the learning process becomes easy. It is my job to create an environment that encourages students to strive to be great musicians, so that they can have the tools to serve their own love for music. Students do not only love music, but also strive to seek complex patterns and musicality (Zatorre). Every note played and practiced should come from a desire to strive for the best music-making experience possible.<br><br>A student’s love for music should be accompanied by developing a true understanding of music theory and history. This is developed not only through an integrated curriculum of playing instruments, learning theory, and understanding historical contexts, but also through experiencing music through singing, movement, and improvisation. Music is so natural yet abstract, so it is very important to equip students with tools to tangibly grasp abstract concepts (Savage). Far too many people have played an instrument at a young age, but completely forget what they learned within a few years. Music education should always strive to produce musicians for life.<br><br>Music also connects people. Every culture has some form of music making, and music is such a universal gateway to experiencing and learning from cultures around the world. It is important for music students to understand music beyond how to play a single instrument in class. As a teacher, I will always strive to expose students to how different cultures interpret and express music. Because music is so integral to culture, it is important shape the music curriculum in a way that furthers the many cultural backgrounds of each identity in the classroom. This philosophy requires emphases on preservation of American microculture, while still taking the extra step to pursue specific aspects and identities of various cultures within the classroom (Elliot). <br><br>Practically, a music education provides students opportunities to learn skills in teamwork, confidence, communication, organization, and leadership (Emiliani). There are many ways students may serve in leadership and team roles, from being a principal player in orchestra to planning fundraisers for the music program. It is part of my job to always make sure that my students feel like a valued member of the program, and I will always work to make sure there is a way for students to serve to best suit their needs and strengths. <br><br>Works cited:<br><br>Elliott, D.
