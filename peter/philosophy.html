    <h2> Teaching Philosophy </h2>
    <div style= "margin: 50px; font-size:25px; ">
I love music because of its universality; it has existed as a part of every recorded human culture (Mehr et al., 2019). Therefore, music not only connects us with other people, but also acts as a lens to perceive cultures and history. As a music educator, I passionately want to go far beyond teaching students how to play instruments within a classroom. I also help students develop intrinsic musicality and musicianship through allowing the student to explore, create, and solve problems on their own. My intention is for my students to be a part of today’s musical culture.<br><br>Naturally, students not only have innate musicality, but also have an inherit love for music (Zatorre, 2018). My ultimate goal is to further increase a student’s natural love for music. If a student loves music, then everything about the learning process becomes more enjoyable, rather than tedious. It is my job to create an environment that encourages students to strive to become great musicians as a means to serve their own love for music. Every note played and practiced should come from a desire to strive for the best music-making experience possible.<br><br>A student’s love for music should be accompanied by developing a true understanding of music theory and history. Music is so natural yet abstract, so it is very important to equip students with tools to tangibly grasp abstract concepts (Savage et al., 2015). These tools are developed through not only an integrated curriculum of playing instruments, learning theory, and understanding historical contexts, but also experiencing music through singing, movement, and improvisation. Far too many people have played an instrument at a young age, but completely forget what they learned within a few years. Music education should always strive to produce musicians for life.<br><br>Music also connects people. Because every culture has some form of music making, music is a universal gateway to experiencing and learning from cultures around the world. As a teacher, I will always strive to expose students to how different cultures interpret and express music. Because music is so integral to culture, it is important to shape the music curriculum in a way that furthers the many cultural backgrounds of each individual in the classroom. A comprehensive philosophy should be “conservative in its concern for preserving the integrity of music cultures (dance cultures, etc.) of the American macroculture, yet liberal insofar as it goes beyond particular cultural preferences to confront beliefs systems, processes, and problems, including the shared concerns of musicians from emerging music cultures.” (Elliot, 1990, p. 163)<br><br>Practically, music education also provides students opportunities to learn skills in teamwork, confidence, communication, organization, and leadership (Emiliani.... , 2013). There are many ways students may serve in leadership and team roles, from being a principle player in orchestra to planning fundraisers for the music program. It is part of my job to always make sure that my students feel like a valued member of the program, and I will always work to make sure there is a way for students to serve, in order to best suit their needs and strengths.
